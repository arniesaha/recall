## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

As an Engineering Manager with 300+ meetings per year, valuable context is scattered across:
- Meeting notes (Granola transcripts)
- 1:1 documentation
- Project updates
- Decision records
- Personal notes

Finding relevant information requires manually searching through files, leading to:
- Lost context before 1:1s
- Forgotten decisions
- Repeated discussions
- Missed action items

### 1.2 Solution

Build a **personal knowledge system** that:
1. Automatically organizes incoming meeting notes
2. Provides intelligent search across all content
3. Surfaces relevant context proactively
4. Works across both work and personal vaults

### 1.3 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to find context for 1:1 | < 30 seconds |
| Query response time | < 5 seconds |
| New file auto-categorization accuracy | > 90% |
| Daily active usage | Used before every 1:1 |

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 Core User Stories

**US-1: Pre-meeting Context**
> As an EM, I want to quickly get context on a person before our 1:1, so I can have a more productive conversation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Query "prep for 1:1 with Alex" returns recent topics, open action items, and discussion history
- Response includes links to source notes
- Works within 5 seconds

**US-2: Decision Recall**
> As an EM, I want to recall past decisions on a topic, so I don't repeat discussions or contradict prior choices.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Query "what did we decide about the migration timeline?" returns relevant decisions with dates
- Includes context of who was involved and why

**US-3: Action Item Tracking**
> As an EM, I want to see open action items for my team, so nothing falls through the cracks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Query "open action items for Jordan" returns pending tasks
- Grouped by date/meeting
- Can filter by project

**US-4: Automatic Organization**
> As a user, I want new Granola notes to be automatically categorized, so I don't have to manually organize files.

Acceptance Criteria:
- New files detected within 5 minutes
- Correctly categorized to people/, projects/, team/, etc.
- Frontmatter added automatically

**US-5: Cross-Vault Search**
> As a user, I want to search across both work and personal vaults, so I have one interface for all my knowledge.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Single search endpoint queries both vaults
- Results indicate source vault
- Can filter by vault if needed

**US-6: Temporal Search**
> As a user, I want to search for "meetings this week" and get only this week's results.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Natural language date expressions parsed automatically
- Supports: today, yesterday, this week, last month, specific dates
- Results filtered to correct date range

### 2.2 Future User Stories (v2)

- **US-7:** Weekly digest of themes and patterns
- **US-8:** Meeting prep suggestions based on calendar
- **US-9:** Integration with Slack for quick queries
- **US-10:** Voice query via mobile
